# Arbitrary Scale Upsampling with Hybrid Attention and Fourier Analysis

This repository holds the content for the class project we carried out for EECS 504 @ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

It includes modifications to the LTE model, by incorporating ideas from HAT on top of the SwinIR that is used as the encoder block.
